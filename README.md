converts handwritten notes into fully searchable PDF documents using Python and OCR technology. It processes scanned images or photos of handwritten pages, 
cleans them using image processing techniques, extracts the text with Tesseract OCR, and generates searchable PDF files. This is especially useful for digitizing lecture notes,
meeting summaries, or paper records.
I developed a mobile OCR (Optical Character Recognition) application using Flutter and Tesseract OCR that extracts text from images in English. Users can capture images via camera 
or upload from the gallery, and the app processes the image to detect and extract the printed text accurately.
Converts handwritten notes into searchable PDFs using Python, OpenCV, and Tesseract OCR. Automates image cleanup, text extraction, and PDF generation.
